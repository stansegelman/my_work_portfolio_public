# Original Schema ‚Äì Subset of Stack Overflow Database

This entry documents a faithful reconstruction of a **subset of the actual Stack Overflow production schema**, used as the foundation for all subsequent portfolio projects.

The schema was extracted and recreated in PostgreSQL with full relational modeling, including foreign key dependencies where applicable. It reflects real-world database complexity, focused on user interactions and core platform behavior.

## üß≠ Schema Structure and Central Tables

The structure of this schema revolves around two primary reference points:

### üßë‚Äçüíº `users` Table ‚Äì Primary Identity Anchor

- Serves as the **central entity** for all user-generated data.
- Referenced by:
  - `posts.owneruserid`
  - `comments.userid`
  - `votes.userid`
  - `badges.userid`
- All major activity originates from or ties back to `users`.

### üìù `posts` Table ‚Äì Core Content Hub

- Stores both **questions and answers** in one table (polymorphic design).
- Connected outward to:
  - `comments.postid`
  - `votes.postid`
  - `postlinks.postid` and `relatedpostid`
  - `posttags` (mapping to `tags`)
- Answers reference their question via `parentid`.

Together, `users` and `posts` form the **spine of the relational graph**. All peripheral tables‚Äîsuch as `comments`, `votes`, `badges`, `tags`, and `postlinks`‚Äîextend outward from these anchors.

This design:
- Supports highly normalized storage
- Enables deep analysis of user behavior
- Allows targeted deletions, partitioning, and historical tracking with minimal redundancy

## üß† Notes

- The `posts` table is polymorphic, storing both questions and answers.
- Foreign key integrity has been preserved or restored where missing.
- This subset focuses on user content and engagement, excluding moderation, messaging, and some metadata tables.
