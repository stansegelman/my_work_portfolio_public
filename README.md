# My Work Portfolio – Stanislav Segelman

Welcome to the portfolio of **Stanislav Segelman**, a database craftsman focused on creativity, structure, integrity, and control.

Everything here was built to solve real problems — under pressure, alone, and without shortcuts.

## 🧰 About Me

I'm a hands-on developer who works from first principles. I’ve been the person cleaning up behind teams that broke things they didn’t understand.

- I design systems for **maximum durability under real-world pressure**.
- I’ve worked as the **sole database owner** in production environments.
